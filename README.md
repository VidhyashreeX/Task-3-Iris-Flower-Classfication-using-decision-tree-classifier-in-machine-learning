# Iris Flower Classification with Decision Tree Classifier

![Iris](https://img.shields.io/badge/Iris%20Flower-Classification-brightgreen)

Welcome to the **Iris Flower Classification** project, an exciting venture as part of my vital internship with Bharat Intern. In this project, we explore the fascinating world of Machine Learning, specifically using a Decision Tree Classifier, to classify Iris flowers based on their unique characteristics. Whether you are a botany enthusiast, a data science enthusiast, or just curious about the power of machine learning in the realm of species identification, this project is designed to provide insights and practical applications.

## About the Project

The classification of Iris flowers is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and is often used as a beginner's benchmark for understanding the classification algorithms. In this project, we leverage the Decision Tree Classifier, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to create a model that can classify Iris flowers into different species based on their petal and sepal attributes.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: We gather data on Iris flowers from various sources, focusing on attributes such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

- **Data Preprocessing**: We clean and prepare the data, ensuring it is suitable for training by handling any missing values and encoding the target variable.

- **Decision Tree Classifier**: We implement the Decision Tree Classifier algorithm to build a model that can classify Iris flowers into their respective species.

- **Model Evaluation**: We assess the model's performance using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **Deployment**: Depending on the project's scope, you can explore deploying the model for real-time flower classification.

## Getting Started

If you're eager to get involved in this project, follow these steps:
